In the realm of concurrent programming, synchronization is a fundamental concept that ensures multiple threads or processes can operate smoothly without interfering with each other. 
Synchronization primitives are essential tools that help manage the access to shared resources, ensuring data integrity and preventing race conditions.
This project focuses on developing a set of scripts to implement key synchronization primitives such as locks and condition variables.
